                    <p>I'm a fourth-year PhD student in Industrial Engineering & Operations Research, advised by 
                    <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/~khl2114/" target="_blank"><strong>Prof. Henry Lam</strong></a>  
                      . My work focuses on uncertainty quantification and decision making under uncertainty—developing methods that remain reliable when data or environments shift.</p>
                  
                    <p>Before Columbia, I completed my bachelor’s and master’s degrees at the Indian Statistical Institute, where my master’s emphasized computational statistics. I also bring industry perspective from my experience at Capital One and in other settings across risk management, data modeling, and related analytics. That experience helps me frame research questions with practical constraints in mind.</p>
                  
                    <p>Outside work, I enjoy chess, table tennis, and puzzle solving. I also love to travel, whether it’s exploring new cities or spending quiet time in unfamiliar places. Long walks through new neighborhoods often leave me thinking differently about structure, systems, and the way people move through the world.</p>
                  
                    <p>If you’re exploring robustness, data-driven optimization, or adjacent topics, I’m always open to a conversation.</p>
